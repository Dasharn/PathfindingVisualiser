# Pathfinding Visualizer - Tasks

This document lists possible future improvements and modifications that can be made to enhance the Pathfinding Visualizer project.

## Task List

- [ ] Implement additional pathfinding algorithms, such as DFS (Depth-First Search) or IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*).
- [ ] Add heuristic options and weights for algorithms that support them, like A* and Greedy.
- [ ] Implement maze generation algorithms, such as Recursive Division or Prim's algorithm, to generate random mazes for pathfinding.
- [ ] Improve the GUI by adding additional functionalities, such as zooming in/out or resizing the grid.
- [ ] Implement an algorithm speed control feature, allowing the user to adjust the speed of visualization.
- [ ] Add the ability to save and load grid configurations, allowing users to save their progress or share interesting scenarios.
- [ ] Implement a statistics panel to display information about the algorithm's performance, such as path length or visited nodes count.
- [ ] Introduce different node types with varying costs, creating a multi-level pathfinding scenario.
- [ ] Implement obstacles with variable sizes or shapes to allow for more complex barrier configurations.
- [ ] Optimize the algorithms for larger grids or complex maze scenarios to improve performance.
- [ ] Add additional visual effects, animations, or sound effects to enhance the user experience.
- [ ] Implement a tutorial or help section to guide new users on how to use the visualizer effectively.
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback, providing clear messages for invalid inputs or edge cases.
- [ ] Refactor and organize the codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and adhere to best practices.
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the algorithms and GUI components.
