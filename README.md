# Pathfinding Visualizer

The Pathfinding Visualizer is a Python application that allows you to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. It provides an interactive GUI where you can set start and end points, add barriers, and choose different pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path between the start and end points.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive grid-based visualization.
- Support for popular pathfinding algorithms including A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, and Greedy.
- Click and drag to set the start and end points on the grid.
- Add barriers by clicking on the grid cells.
- Clear nodes by right-clicking on the grid cells.
- Reset the grid to its initial state.
- Real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress.
- Different colors represent different states of nodes (start, end, barrier, visited, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dasharn/PathSense.git

2. Install the required dependencies
pip install pygame

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory
cd pathfinding-visualiser

2. Run the visualiser
python visualiser.py

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the visualiser
- Use the 'a' key for A* algorithm, 'd' key for Dijkstra's algorithm, 'b' key for BFS algorithm, and 'g' key for Greedy algorithm.
- Left-click to set the start and end points, and add barriers.
- Right-click to clear nodes.
- Press 'r' to reset the grid.
